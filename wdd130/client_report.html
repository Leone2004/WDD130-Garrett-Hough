            <h2>Client Report</h2>
           <p><strong>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</strong></p>
           <p>I decided on the content and images because I am very passionate about soccer and I wanted to share my love for the sport with others. I'm a first semester student here at BYUI and didn't have any friends coming in. I wanted to help make a community of soccer players here at BYUI that would be easily accssible to anyone that is interested in playing. Whether that be for a competitive team or just for fun, I wanted to make it easy for people to find the information they need to join.</p>
            <p><strong> How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</strong></p> 
            <p>We communicated through text messages and emails. I was able to get ahold of Parker at anytime. He asked me to send him extra images of people playing soccer. I love that he took the initiative to ask and try and make my original plan even better.</p>
            <p><strong>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</strong></p>
             He did in some aspects and didn't in others. He did a great job with the colors and overall layout of the site. However I on the home page he has a big image as the header. I love that part but don't like the text on the inside. I thought originally that it would get fixed but as of right now it's still that way.
            <p><strong>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</strong></p>
            <p>I will be more in the details of the project. I originally wanted to give him a little more freedom as to what to make and he honestly did great. I would be more in the details of the project and check in more often to make sure that he is doing what I think looks good.</p>

            <h2>Lead Developer</h2>
            <b><p>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?</p></b>
            <p>I was able to communicate with my team in person. There wasn't a lot to communicate about because of the simple webplan and so we just used the time in class to talk about the project. It was the same way with the client.
               <b><p>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</p></b>
            <p>I was able to publish the site and share it with the client through github. Github allowed me to create a global website link and send it to the client. I was able to share the link with the client and they were able to see the site and give me feedback on what they liked and what they didn't like.</p>
            <b><p>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</p></b>
            <p>I loved it. I was able to create a global website link and send it to the client. It was a great way to work as a team and we didn't have any merge conflicts to worry about. I was able to see the changes that were made to the site and change things around as needed.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Junior Developer</h2>
           <b><p>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</p></b>
           <p>I was able to communicate with my team lead in person. We were able to talk about the project and what we were going to do. Angelique was great at communicating with me and helping me understand the project. She was also great at giving me feedback on my work and helping me improve. At first I didn't understand the way that I could do my part in the project because of a lack of information. However after talking through it I began to understand the way that the client had invisioned the site. Once I understood her vision I was able to effectively program the junior site.</p>
           <b><p>   Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</p></b>
           <p>Yes, I knew what was expected of me for each site. I was able to contribute and make my part of the site. For one of my sites I made the database and for the other I made the More Information page. Both of which turned out well, I got the html in and then would try to map and copy the css of the home page. </p>
           <b><p>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</p></b>
           <p>Yes, I was able to contribute to my site. I was able to make my part of the site and make it look good. I was able to make the database and the More Information page. Both of which turned out well, I got the html in and then would try to map and copy the css of the home page. </p>
           <b><p>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</p></b>
           <p>No, I didn't run into any issues with GitHub and adding my changes to the sites. I was able to add my changes to the sites without any merge conflicts. It ended up being a great experience and I was able to learn a lot about Github and how to use it as a small team.</p>

            <h2>General Experience</h2>
            <p>My experience with this project was great. We took everything we had learned in class and applied it to the projects. I think one of the greatest parts of this project was the creative liberty that was given to each client. It was very awesome to see other peoples ideas and visions come to life. I also loved the feedback that I was able to give to the client and how they were able to use it to make the site better.</p>
            <p>If I did this again I would change a lot of what I did. I think I should've been much better about communicating with the client. I think I should've been more in the details of the project and checked in more often to make sure that I was doing what the client wanted. I also think I should've been more in the details of the project and checked in more often to make sure that I was doing what the client, lead, and junior devs. All of the projects were great and turned out fine, but I think that I should've been more in the details of the project and checked in more often to make sure that I was doing what the client wanted.</p>
