            <p>I have been playing soccer for nearly 7 years now. I played in highschool and
                even made it to the collegate level. I ended my careet and just play for fun 
                now, but often still join in tournaments and legues. I am currently playing for 
                a competitve and recreational team here at BYUI.

       <p>I enjoy creating things with wood and metal. I studied welding and a
        little bit of woodworking. The picture up top is one of the projects that 
        I worked on. It's a grill pit with a table around it. This allows for you
        and your friends or family to be able to grill and eat at the same time.

            <p>I am a current student enrolled at Brigham Young University in Idaho. 
            I am very religous and have a happy go lucky personality. I try my hardest
            to go from good to better and better to best. If you don't give 100% into 
            everything then I see it as a missed opportunity. My father was deployed after
            the 9/11 attacks on the U.S and my family ended up moving quite a lot. I have
            lived in Illinois, California, Utah, Pennsylvania, Texas, The Philippines, and 
            Idaho. My hobbies are Soccer, Video Games, Coding, Hiking, Swimming, Volleyball.
            I grew up in a family of 11 and am the 6th child. This has been a tremendous 
            experience for me and has allowed me to value family relations very highly.
